# Sorting Algorithms in Python

This repository contains a collection of sorting algorithms implemented in Python. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science, and these algorithms are essential for understanding algorithmic principles and improving your problem-solving skills.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed.

2. **Selection Sort**: This algorithm divides the input list into two parts: the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.

3. **Insertion Sort**: In this algorithm, we start with an empty sorted list and repeatedly insert the next element from the unsorted list into its correct position in the sorted list.

4. **Merge Sort**: Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the input array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves to produce a single sorted array.

5. **Quick Sort**: Quick sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that chooses a "pivot" element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

6. **Heap Sort**: This sorting algorithm works by first converting the input list into a binary heap data structure. Then, it repeatedly removes the maximum element from the heap and appends it to the sorted part of the list.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python: You need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-algorithms-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sorting-algorithms-python
   ```

3. You can run any of the sorting algorithms by executing the corresponding Python file. For example, to run the Bubble Sort algorithm, use:

   ```bash
   python bubble_sort.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions (if any) to provide input or observe the sorted output.

## Usage

You can use these sorting algorithms to sort lists of various data types. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs. Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its respective Python file.
