#Bubble sort
#Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list,
#compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
#This process continues until no swaps are needed, indicating the list is sorted.
#The algorithm iterates through the list for 'n' elements (length of the list).
#Within each iteration, it compares adjacent elements from the beginning of the list to the (n - i - 1)-th element.
#If an element is greater than the one next to it, a swap is performed.
#This process is repeated until the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the list.
#The next iteration is then performed on the remaining unsorted portion.
#The process repeats until no more swaps are needed, indicating the list is sorted.
#Bubble Sort is inefficient for large lists but is easy to understand and implement.
#It has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, making it impractical for large datasets.
